 1. In my head
- [ ] docker simple cmd to github
- [ ] tensorflow slim use go deep
- [ ] update C timeit to github
- [ ] python numpy usable misc
- [ ] tensorflow slicing
- [x] C timeit use patch

 2. Spark (need rebase in future)
- [ ] shareable RDD 
- [ ] shuffle service workflow
- [ ] worker lifecycle
- [x] maintain an open-source env for debug
